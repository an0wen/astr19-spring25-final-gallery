Dylan Louie, "A mean average of coloring the 6 IR channels as blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange as defined by matplotlib.colors. The false color creator enjoys how it makes the universe look dark and mysterious with a lovely royal sheen of gold.", 1RULkHQUy2sY2WkQa7yg4vdQwUd7O2sIV
Dylan Louie, "A average of 2 adjacent filters into 1 channel turning 6 channels into 3, and interpreting it in the HSV spectrum. The false color creator finds the bright purple stars exciting with a lovely contrast against the green ""clouds"" which have a nice gradient from blueish green to orangish brown which gives it depth.", 1qZ6slUTbZkY7tYPNEuLe95K-dGo1AoBJ
